The user gets the option to sign up or sign in. A new user is provided with a UMI(Unique Metro ID) which is auto generated and also an auto generated password. The user can change the password later on. There are two types of method for travelling- one is TIME BASED travel and the second is the DESTINATION BASED.
<br>
Time based travel:<br>
This tries to replicate the card based system of the DMRC where user only enters the station name where he/she boards and then journey starts. The user can end the journey whenever he/she wants by entering ENTER key. In whole journey the station names appear automatically after a fixed interval of time.
Destination based travel:<br>
This tries to replicate the ticket based system of the DMRC where user enters the names of both boarding and ending station. The journey automatically gets over when destination is reached.

If users forget their password during checkin, they can change their password and then try again.
